Challenge-11 Express.js


# Description
This project was tough and needs some work to be fully polished and working. Having the front end code completed allowed me to focus solely on the back end and tying the two together. That came with it's on set of challenges. Mainly interrupting someone elses code and getting it to work with my own. All in all it was a good experience and will help me in the future when I am working on a team with other developers.

# Usage
from the command line clone this repo. From there you can run an "NPM I" to install the needed packages. Once that is done you can run "NPM start" which will allow the app to run locally. For a more seamless user experiance I would recommend using the link to the deployed application.

# Credits
Source code was taken from the "OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC" repository. Lessons from module 10-OPP and 11-Express from the previously mentioned repository were used as a reference point for where to begin. 
Stack Overflow and nodejs.org were used as a reference and to come up with the proper syntax for this project
